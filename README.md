A wake word classifier built using Raspberry Pico H and a ADMP401 Microphone for the Embedded Systems Project.

The aim of this embedded systems project is to turn on the main LED on the board when a user says the word "YES" into the microphone and it will turn off when the user says the word "NO".

We have found that the model works with the greatest accuracy when speaking in a Male voice using an American Accent along with a deep tone.
